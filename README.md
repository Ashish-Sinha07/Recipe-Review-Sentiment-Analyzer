# Recipe-Review-Sentiment-Analyzer

The objective of this project is to analyze user sentiment from recipe reviews
where no explicit sentiment labels are provided. We aim to:
1. Extract sentiment from textual reviews
2. Use ratings as weak supervision to create sentiment labels
3. Compare text-based sentiment with user ratings and engagement
4. Build machine learning models to predict sentiment
5. Derive actionable insights from user feedback
